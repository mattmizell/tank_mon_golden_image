# Security Check Report - Golden Image 2025-07-07

## Files Checked:
✅ config.json - Generic values only
✅ *.py files - No hardcoded credentials
✅ Service files - No secrets
✅ Deploy scripts - No API keys

## Findings:

### SAFE - No sensitive data found in:
- **config.json**: Contains only generic/default values
  - Store name: "UNCONFIGURED"
  - IP: Generic 192.168.1.100
  - API URL: Public endpoint
  
- **Python files**: No hardcoded passwords or API keys
- **Service files**: Only contain file paths and user names

### MINOR - Documentation mentions:
- **DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: References password "training1" as an example
  - This is acceptable as it's clearly marked as a setup instruction
  - Users should change this password

### Verified Clean:
- No API keys or tokens
- No production passwords
- No private IP addresses (only generic 192.168.x.x)
- No customer data
- No proprietary information

## Recommendation:
✅ **SAFE TO PUSH TO GITHUB**

The golden image contains only generic configuration and code necessary for deployment. All sensitive configuration will be added by users during deployment.
